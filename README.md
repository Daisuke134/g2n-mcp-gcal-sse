## Overview

G2N MCP Google Calendar SSE Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation that provides Google Calendar integration through Server-Sent Events (SSE). This server exposes Google Calendar functionality as tools that can be used by AI models and applications like Cursor, Claude, and n8n to interact with Google Calendar.

Built with the latest version of the MCP SDK, this server offers a robust integration between MCP-compatible AI models and Google Calendar services.

## Features

The server provides the following MCP tools for Google Calendar management:

- `list-calendars`: List all available calendars
- `get-calendar`: Get details of a specific calendar
- `list-events`: List events from a calendar with filtering options
- `get-event`: Get detailed information about a specific event
- `create-event`: Create a new calendar event
- `update-event`: Update an existing calendar event
- `delete-event`: Delete a calendar event
- `list-colors`: List available colors for events and calendars

### What's New in v0.1.2

- **Multi-platform Docker support**: Now built for AMD64, ARM64, and ARMv7
- **Docker Swarm ready**: Added Swarm deployment configurations and resource limits
- **Better container health checks**: Enhanced container monitoring
- **GitHub Actions integration**: Automated builds for multi-architecture images
- **Improved resource management**: Optimized memory and CPU configurations
- **Version fix**: Corrected version numbering in all project files

## Architecture

The project follows a clean architecture approach with:

- **Strong typing**: Consistent type definitions using Zod schemas and TypeScript
- **Modular design**: Separation of concerns between authentication, services, and tools
- **Docker support**: Multi-platform container deployment for ease of use
- **Swarm ready**: Configuration optimized for Docker Swarm deployments

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Google Cloud Project with Calendar API enabled
- OAuth 2.0 Client ID and Client Secret

### Quick Start with Docker

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gabriel-g2n/g2n-mcp-gcal-sse.git
   cd g2n-mcp-gcal-sse
   ```

2. Create an `.env` file based on the `.env.example`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. Edit the `.env` file and fill in your Google API credentials:
   ```
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
   ```

4. Run the Docker container:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

5. Navigate to the authentication URL to authorize the application:
   ```
   http://localhost:3001/auth
   ```
   
6. Follow the OAuth flow in your browser to grant access to your Google Calendar.

7. Once authorization is complete, the server will be available at http://localhost:3001

### Docker Swarm Deployment

For production deployment with Docker Swarm:

```bash
# Initialize swarm if not already done
docker swarm init

# Create Docker secrets for sensitive information (recommended)
echo "your-client-id" | docker secret create google_client_id -
echo "your-client-secret" | docker secret create google_client_secret -

# Deploy the stack
docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml g2n-mcp-gcal
```

For a more secure setup with Docker Swarm, uncomment and use the examples in the `docker-compose.yml` file to use secrets instead of environment variables.

After deployment, navigate to `http://your-server:3001/auth` to complete the OAuth authorization flow.

### Docker Swarm with Traefik Deployment

When deploying in a Docker Swarm environment with Traefik, follow these steps to ensure proper configuration:

1. Set the `PUBLIC_URL` environment variable to match your domain:

```bash
# Create a .env file for your deployment
cat > .env << EOF
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
PUBLIC_URL=https://mcp-gcal.yourdomain.com
TRAEFIK_HOST=mcp-gcal.yourdomain.com
EOF
```

2. Deploy the stack with the environment variables:

```bash
docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml g2n-mcp-gcal --with-registry-auth
```

3. Important notes for using behind Traefik:
   - The `PUBLIC_URL` variable is **critical** for OAuth callbacks to work
   - It must match the public URL where your service is accessible
   - This URL will be used for Google OAuth redirects
   - Traefik labels are preconfigured in the docker-compose.yml file
   - For HTTPS, uncomment the secure Traefik labels in docker-compose.yml

4. If using Portainer for managing your Swarm:
   - In the Portainer stack deployment UI, add the environment variables:
     - `PUBLIC_URL`: https://mcp-gcal.yourdomain.com
     - `TRAEFIK_HOST`: mcp-gcal.yourdomain.com
   - Deploy your stack as usual through the Portainer interface

## Multi-platform Support

The Docker image is built for multiple platforms including:
- linux/amd64 (Intel/AMD processors)
- linux/arm64 (ARM64 processors like Raspberry Pi 4, Apple Silicon M1/M2/M3)
- linux/arm/v7 (ARMv7 processors like Raspberry Pi 3)

To build a multi-architecture image using our provided script:

```bash
npm run docker:build-multi
```

Or manually:

```bash
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64,linux/arm/v7 \
  -t gabrielg2n/g2n-mcp-gcal-sse:0.1.2 \
  --push .
```

## Authentication Flow

1. Start the server using Docker or directly
2. Navigate to `/auth` endpoint in your browser
3. Grant permissions to the application using your Google account
4. After authorization, the server will store refresh tokens for continued access
5. The server will automatically refresh tokens when needed

To revoke access, use the `/revoke` endpoint:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/revoke
```

## Usage with MCP-compatible Applications

### Cursor AI

You can use this server with Cursor AI by configuring the MCP connection in your settings:

1. Open Cursor settings
2. Configure the MCP server URL: `http://localhost:3001/sse`
3. Start using Google Calendar features through AI commands

### Claude Desktop

For Claude Desktop:

1. Navigate to Settings > MCP
2. Add a new MCP connection with the URL: `http://localhost:3001/sse`
3. Access Google Calendar functionality through your conversations

### n8n

1. In n8n, add a new MCP node
2. Configure the MCP node with the SSE endpoint URL: `http://localhost:3001/sse`
3. Use the exposed calendar tools in your workflows

## Development

To set up a development environment:

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Navigate to the authorization URL:
   ```
   http://localhost:3001/auth
   ```

4. Build the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. Build Docker image:
   ```bash
   npm run docker:build
   ```

6. Push Docker image:
   ```bash
   npm run docker:push
   ```

## Project Structure

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ auth/              # Authentication and token management
â”œâ”€â”€ services/          # Core service implementations 
â”œâ”€â”€ tools/             # MCP tool definitions
â”œâ”€â”€ types/             # Type definitions with Zod schemas
â””â”€â”€ index.ts           # Application entry point
```

## CI/CD with GitHub Actions

The project includes a GitHub Actions workflow that:

1. Builds the Docker image for multiple platforms
2. Pushes the image to Docker Hub
3. Creates appropriate tags based on git tags (for releases) and commits

To create a new release:

```bash
git tag v0.1.2
git push origin v0.1.2
```

This will trigger the workflow to build and publish the tagged release.

## Persistence and Data Management

The server stores tokens in a volume mounted at `/app/data`. This ensures that your authentication persists across container restarts.

For Docker Swarm deployments, consider using a shared volume or a networked storage solution to ensure token persistence across swarm nodes.
